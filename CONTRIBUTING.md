This wiki is made up of Markdown files.  [Here's a good reference for the Markdown syntax.](https://en.support.wordpress.com/markdown-quick-reference/)
To create a new page, simply make a new file with a .md extension and use whatever text editor you prefer.  Preferrably the files should use
UNIX-style line endings (just newline chracters and no carriage returns).
